# Elevate EDA

Elevate EDA is a comprehensive data exploration tool designed to streamline and enhance the process of performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**. It provides users with an intuitive interface, powerful visualizations, and insights to better understand and make sense of their datasets.

## Features
- **Data Visualization:** Create a wide range of graphs and charts, including histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps, and more.
- **Summary Statistics:** Easily generate summary statistics for your datasets, including mean, median, variance, and standard deviation.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Visualize the relationships between different features with correlation matrices.
- **Interactive UI:** Built with Streamlit, offering an easy-to-use, interactive interface.
- **Automated Reports:** Export reports in a customizable format for presentations and decision-making.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core programming language used for data processing.
- **Streamlit**: Framework for building the user interface.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**: Visualization libraries for creating plots.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computing.
- **Scikit-learn**: For data preprocessing and basic machine learning tasks.

## Installation

To get started with Elevate EDA, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Jenishajustin/elevate-eda.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    streamlit run app.py
    ```

6. **Access the web app:**
   Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:8501/`.

## Usage

1. Upload your dataset (CSV format).
2. Explore summary statistics, data visualizations, and correlations.
3. Generate insights through visual tools provided in the app.
4. Optionally, download an automated EDA report summarizing the key findings.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use Elevate EDA on a sample dataset:

1. Upload your data using the file uploader.
2. View visualizations like correlation heatmaps, box plots, and pair plots.
3. Analyze outliers and generate descriptive statistics.
